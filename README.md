Hidden in the Data: Crafting Policies to Address Inequality — Women’s Institute for Science
* Policies to reduce inequality needs to examine where inequality is greatest: race, gender, wealth— situational to context (Quisumbing, 2021)
* "I am waiting for the study that tells me what my wealth looks like, as a single woman who doesn't have children, I've never been married— how do I compare, not just to my white peers, but how do I compare to other women, how do I compare to other men, I want to see data aggregated in that way." (Sharpe, 2021)
* Want to see researchers come in disaggregating data not just with a deficit lens, to see the "problem", but also to see what's working well, what conditions are creating success, what are the nuances (Sharpe, 2021)
* Want to see context-aware aggregation choices for data (Sharpe, 2021)
* Public servant challenges in useful dissemination of resources when data is not disaggregated (da Costa, 2021)
* Data is not equally available across all racial groups, want to be able to compare everyone in a similar manner so that we as researchers can ask questions and put data behind grassroots efforts (Sharpe, 2021)
* Often Native American community is considered statistically insignificant, left out of analyses (MartinRogers, 2021)
* Survey methods also need to be context-aware, e.g. if surveying on domestic violence, the phone may be answered more often by the husband, or with spouse in room, useful to come up with flagging questions e.g. are you on speakerphone, to assess risk to group under study and validity of interpreting answers at face value (Quisumbing, 2021)
* What is “essential workers”? How did we moderate who had to work in person vs. who was prioritized for vaccines for doctors vs grocery cashiers? What else aligns with those profession categories? (Sharpe, 2021)
* Deciding on sensitive demographic questions: are we going to do something with this data if we ask for it? (MartinRogers, 2021)
* Public datasets e.g. census may be used in ways not imagined by original data collectors, e.g. civil rights work from collection of demographics (Sharpe, 2021)
* Look at what's happening within the data, not just at the household level— allows for intersectional analysis (Quisumbing, 2021)
* When we're asking people to disaggregate data, we want to look at the types of questions we are trying to ask. Data disaggregation is a mechanic for stronger analysis in the context of the issue you're looking at. (Sharpe, 2021)
* Datasets & data presentation often shows categorical demographic impacts but does not let you examine intersectionally—e.g. age, race, but the question is, did a generation of Black children lose grandparents? (Sharpe, 2021)
* What racist narratives are scientifically falsifiable? What data is being collected to establish science on these narratives? (Unseld, 2021)
* Anecdotal data is useful to collect (e.g. elected official talking points, social media) in order to construct more rigorously testable questions. (Unseld, 2021)
* When policies are funded, we can scientifically test the impact of that funding. Treat policies as scientific experiments: does the policy have the desired effect? If provably no, we should not fund. If not provable, why are we not collecting the relevant data? If theory of change of a policy is unclear, why? Do talking points match the budget? (Unseld, 2021)
* Frederick Tutman, Black riverkeeper. Talking about conflicts of influence between career-seekers and true environmental justice work: fundable, obvious, broad issues e.g. climate change can draw focus from direct needs of communities for specific and immediate pollutant changes (Tutman, 2021)
* Jason Williams, Dominion Energy: effective approaches in industry for including EJ review in prioritization & outreach for public comment (Williams, 2021)
* Is the goal to: Protect those whose bodies are most physically vulnerable to criteria pollutants? Not increase racial disparities? Address and correct racial disparities? Redress existing and past racial disparities? Provide the greatest good to the greatest number irrespective of race? (Harrison, 2019)
* EJ is specifically non-neoliberal (Harrison, 2019)
* Cumulative impacts:  full scope of environmental stressors a community faces and vulnerability to them (Harrison, 2019)




* "Standard narrative" of agency workers for why EJ policy implementation falls short at gvt level: limited resources, regulatory authority, and analytical tools (Harrison, 2019)

## Existing approaches to EJ in Environmental Governance
* Permitting critical to EJ, shapes community's experience. (Harrison, 2019)
* Main focus at EPA agencies has been increasing public comment accessibility: advertise and make time and location accessible to target population, present context without jargon and in non-English language (Harrison, 2019)

## EJ Issues in Environmental Governance
* Enforcement less good among vulnerable populations (Konisky and Reenock, 2015) in (Harrison, 2019)
* "One EPA rulewriter told me in 2018 that EJ analyses are rarely done and managers 'never' use EJ analyses to shape the final rule. EPA's guidance documents on rulemaking say that rulewriting staff 'can' and 'should' conduct EJ analyses to 'consider EJ' during the development of new or revised regulations, but not that they *must* do so, despite the fact that doing so is required under the National Environmental Policy Act. Moreover, agency decision-makers are under no obligation to ensure that the final rule improves material conditions in overburdened and vulnerable communities and reduces environmental inequalities. EJ advocates lament that very little of any final rule has reflected EJ concerns." (Harrison, 2019)
* "They way the agency assesses this risk [air toxics] vastly underestimates residents' exposure, according to our analysis. Instead of looking at how cancer risk adds up when polluters are clustered together in a neighborhood, the EPA examines certain types of facilities and equipment in isolation." (Vest, 2021)

## Ideas for improving EJ in environmental governance
* EJ variables used in (Ewing, 2021): Age, sex, immigrant population, aboriginal population, after tax income, median rent, median property value, visible minorities. Material deprivation index: prop wo hs deg, employment to pop ratio, avg income for 15 and over Social deprivation index : prop of pop over 15 living alone or sep div widowed, prop single parent (Ewing, 2021)
* Suggestions: Prioritize and increase inspections in overburdened areas, use maximum penalties, penalties should benefit community (Harrison, 2019)
