## Uncategorized notes
* "Data has the potential to be used as evidence for the development of unjust policies." (Williams, 2020)
* "Unlocking data for policy change works best when the process engages multidisciplinary teams that include policy experts, data scientists, and data visualizers, among others." (Williams, 2020)
* "Redlining maps disguise visible structural bias as objective truth." (Williams, 2020)
* On different types of data as fundamentally different views of communities: "[Jane] Jacobs is holding documents with citizens' signatures, while [Robert] Moses stands in front of one of his urban renewal projects holding a report full of data analytics offering evidence for the development." (Williams, 2020)
* "Inherent to [Shelly] Arnstein's approach was the need to target broader publics, including communities typically marginalized by public participation processes, because they do not have the resources and data to advocate for their needs." (Williams, 2020)
* "James Glass, who writes about citizen participation in planning, believed that information exchange that involved education, building support, supplemental decision-making, and representational input could change power relationships within public engagement strategies." (Williams, 2020)
* "Data can be used for action: it's how we work with data that determines its potential to help society." (Williams, 2020)
* "The explosion of [open source GIS] software has created a new group of data enthusiasts who are not aways aware of the risks of using data. This has produced a lot of 'bad' or inaccurate analysis, not necessarily out of malice, but rather a lack of data literacy." (Williams, 2020)

### Defining civic science
* "We describe this form of citizen science as 'Civic Science' which, following Fortun and Fortun (2005) is a 'science that empowers people to question the state of things rather than simply serving the state'". (Wylie et al, 2017)
* A research project as "civic" when it aims to bring "the infrastructures responsible for sustaining collective human lives ... into a space of public contemplation and accountability." (Wylie et al, 2017)
* Civic science as aiming for research that is "community centered, precautionary, and politically engaged" (Wylie et al, 2017)

### The role of technologies
* Framing specific technologies not as ends in themselves, but as useful in enabling us to ask or answer questions differently, what political potentials they hold, how they can manifest ethos (Wylie et al, 2017)
* "Civic Science that focuses exclusively on tool redesign to generate quantitative environmental data can further the scientizing of society..." (Wylie et al, 2017)
* "It is not realistic to expect any technology solution to result in zero harm, especially when deployed at scale." (MacKinnon, 2021)
* "For Web3 companies seeking to ensure that human rights harms are addressed and mitigated when they are identified—whether by staff, members of their user communities, or external stakeholders—it is important to set up accountability mechanisms and corporate governance structures that impose consequences for ignoring or fail to act upon such information." (MacKinnon, 2021)
