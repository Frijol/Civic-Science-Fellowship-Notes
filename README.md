# Notes

Design Justice by Sasha Constanza-Chock:
Nothing about us, without us
All design offers affordances to some & disaffordances + dysaffordances to others. Are you designing to meet the needs of a majority, or to rectify historic imbalances? Who benefits from what you build?
Asset-based rather than problem-based framing: how can our work build on the existing strengths of the communities we seek to serve? 
Create an MOU with each CBO for better transparency and accountability: what resources will be provided? Who is involved and what are their roles? Who owns outputs, and who gets credit?
Mitigate the asymmetry of differently resourced participant groups: what do members of the community really get out of this research work?

But make it intersectional 
Material deprivation index:  prop wo hs deg, employment to pop ratio, avg income for 15 and over
Social deprivation index : prop of pop over 15 living alone or sep div widowed, prop single parent
Hidden in the Data: Crafting Policies to Address Inequality — Women’s Institute for Science
Policies to reduce inequality needs to examine where inequality is greatest: race, gender, wealth— situational to context
What does aggregation of data across demographics hide? Disaggregate to see the characteristics of groups that are doing well, poorly, other
Public servant challenges in useful dissemination of resources when data is not disaggregated (KB: similar critique applies to EJScreen single-number index)
Datasets & data presentation often shows categorical demographic impacts but does not let you examine intersectionally—e.g. age, race, but the question is, did a generation of Black children lose grandparents?
What is “essential workers”? How did we moderate who had to work in person vs. who was prioritized for vaccines for doctors vs grocery cashiers? What else aligns with those profession categories?
Deciding on sensitive demographic questions: are we going to do something with this data if we ask for it?
Public datasets e.g. census may be used in ways not imagined by original data collectors, e.g. civil rights from collection of demographics
Center work on a vulnerability, but ensure analysis isn’t deficit-based
Challenging Racist Narratives with Monica Unseld:
What racist narratives are scientifically falsifiable? What data is being collected to establish science on these narratives?
Anecdotal data is useful to collect (e.g. elected official talking points, social media) in order to construct more rigorously testable questions.
When policies are funded, we can scientifically test the impact of that funding. Treat policies as scientific experiments: does the policy have the desired effect? If provably no, we should not fund. If not provable, why are we not collecting the relevant data? If theory of change of a policy is unclear, why? Do talking points match the budget?
Achieving Environmental Justice: Lessons from Communities, Companies, and Government (ELI 2021 Corporate & Policy Forum)
Frederick Tutman, Black riverkeeper. Talking about conflicts of influence between career-seekers and true environmental justice work: fundable, obvious, broad issues e.g. climate change can draw focus from direct needs of communities for specific and immediate pollutant changes
Jason Williams, Dominion Energy: effective approaches in industry for including EJ review in prioritization & outreach for public comment
From the Inside Out: The Fight for Environmental Justice Within Government Agencies by Jill Lindsey Harrison
Is the goal to:
Protect those whose bodies are most physically vulnerable to criteria pollutants
Not increase racial disparities 
Address and correct racial disparities
Redress existing and past racial disparities
Provide the greatest good to the greatest number irrespective of race
EJ is specifically non-neoliberal 
Cumulative impacts:  full scope of environmental stressors a community faces and vulnerability to them
"Standard narrative" for why EJ policy implementation falls short at gvt level: limited resources, regulatory authority, and analytical tools
