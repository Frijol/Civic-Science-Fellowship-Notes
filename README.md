* Seeing Like an Oil Company: Ferguson, 2005

## Uncategorized
* "We lack social and scientific methods as well as regulatory systems capable of tracking [fossil fuel and petrochemical] industries across arenas of extraction, transport, processing, and manufacture; across borders and across hazards." (Wylie et al, 2017)
* "How can the health and ecosystem costs of the [petrochemical] industry be made collectively evident?" (Wylie et al, 2017)
* "The less democratic a state, the more its oil extraction can thrive, as less attention needs to be paid to consequences for local inhabitants." (Wylie et al, 2017)
* The oil rig as extracting a resource using flown-in laborers who live and work separately from the local population; the whole system moveable - resulting in the political outcome of reduced local & national oversight of resource extaction (Wylie et al, 2017)
* "Academic work with communities is often framed as political work and can be frowned on as a form of advocacy." (Wylie et al, 2017) esp in reaction to the "neutrality" of work for industries
* "Even town hall presentations given by community members working with data gathered by [NIH-funded] scientists must be disclosed under lobbying provisions." (Wylie et al, 2017)
* "In contexts where there are widespread environmental and health impacts but little information about harms and their causes, communities often turn to collecting, sharing, and leveraging their own data." (Wylie et al, 2017)
* Critique of a common form of citizen science: "These cases are based on massive, crowd-sourced data processing or observing activities where participants are engaged in science without pay, do not shape the research questions or tools, and the results of data have little impact on socio-technical systems and power relationships, not on how science is done." (Wylie et al, 2017)
* "There are always power asymmetries in citizen science, for example, between legitimized and institutionalized forms of knowledge and lay knowledge, and between citizens and accredited scientists." (Wylie et al, 2017)
* "We describe this form of citizen science as 'Civic Science' which, following Fortun and Fortun (2005) is a 'science that empowers people to question the state of things rather than simply serving the state'". (Wylie et al, 2017)
* A research project as "civic" when it aims to bring "the infrastructures responsible for sustaining collective human lives ... into a space of public contemplation and accountability." (Wylie et al, 2017)
* Civic science as aiming for research that is "community centered, precautionary, and politically engaged" (Wylie et al, 2017)
* [in order to have impact], "Community tools must be validated by state and industry standards, which risks reinforcing rather than subverting inadequate norms of what counts as data and expanding the scientization of society such that only those with 'data' have a voice." (Wylie et al, 2017)
* "What is the responsibility for STS researchers to question the 'facticity ' or 'uncertainty' of forms of data that are instrumentally useful to for [sic] impacted communities?" - on the over-auditing of potentially flawed data that comes from citizen science, used as gatekeeping. Called the 'data treadmill' (Wylie et al, 2017)
* "A serious concern for us is the tension between the abdication of state environmental protections and the individualized burden of data collection (Kinchy et al. 2011). We do not want to continue a trend where non-scientists must do the work of governments and accredited scientists to be healthy." (Wylie et al, 2017)
* How can organizations designed to bridge citizen science & agencies of the state meaningfully connect all parties so they can mutually reinforce and sustain each other? (Wylie et al, 2017)
* Framing specific technologies not as ends in themselves, but as useful in enabling us to ask or answer questions differently, what political potentials they hold, how they can manifest ethos (Wylie et al, 2017)
* "Civic Science that focuses exclusively on tool redesign to generate quantitative environmental data can further the scientizing of society..." (Wylie et al, 2017)
* "Developing research methods and networks that account for oil and gas infrastructures as material systems with interdependent biological, ecological, social, and political properties through hybrid physical and social science inquiry could help better affix this industry to the physical environments and communities it impacts." (Wylie et al, 2017)

* UN Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues recognized, in its first two sessions (2002 & 2003) that a lack of disaggregated data on indigenous peoples makes it difficult to formulate & implement indigenous-sensitive policies (Kukutai and Taylor, xxi)
* "Data should be generated to measure how the rights of indigenous peoples to access the ownership of lands, territories and resources are being met; how their participation in decision-making and control over their own development processes are progressing; what control over data and knowledge they are achieving; and what discrimination and exclusion they experience in regard to their social, economic and cultural rights. In terms of approaches and methodologies, it was stressed in these UN forums that indigenous peoples should control these data and that their effective participation in data gathering and research should be ensured. Furthermore, resulting data should be available for use by them in policy articulation, in planning and in monitoring and evaluation efforts." (Kukutai and Taylor, xxi)
