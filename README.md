# Notes

## Existing approaches to EJ in Environmental Governance
* Permitting critical to EJ, shapes community's experience. (Harrison, 2019)
* Main focus at EPA agencies has been increasing public comment accessibility: advertise and make time and location accessible to target population, present context without jargon and in non-English language (Harrison, 2019)

## EJ Issues in Environmental Governance
* Enforcement less good among vulnerable populations (Konisky and Reenock, 2015) in (Harrison, 2019)
* "One EPA rulewriter told me in 2018 that EJ analyses are rarely done and managers 'never' use EJ analyses to shape the final rule. EPA's guidance documents on rulemaking say that rulewriting staff 'can' and 'should' conduct EJ analyses to 'consider EJ' during the development of new or revised regulations, but not that they *must* do so, despite the fact that doing so is required under the National Environmental Policy Act. Moreover, agency decision-makers are under no obligation to ensure that the final rule improves material conditions in overburdened and vulnerable communities and reduces environmental inequalities. EJ advocates lament that very little of any final rule has reflected EJ concerns." (Harrison, 2019)
* "They way the agency assesses this risk [air toxics] vastly underestimates residents' exposure, according to our analysis. Instead of looking at how cancer risk adds up when polluters are clustered together in a neighborhood, the EPA examines certain types of facilities and equipment in isolation." (Vest, 2021)

## Ideas for improving EJ in environmental governance
* EJ variables used in (Ewing, 2021): Age, sex, immigrant population, aboriginal population, after tax income, median rent, median property value, visible minorities. Material deprivation index: prop wo hs deg, employment to pop ratio, avg income for 15 and over Social deprivation index : prop of pop over 15 living alone or sep div widowed, prop single parent (Ewing, 2021)
* Suggestions: Prioritize and increase inspections in overburdened areas, use maximum penalties, penalties should benefit community (Harrison, 2019)
