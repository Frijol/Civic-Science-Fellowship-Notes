# Working with Communities

* Asset-based rather than problem-based framing: how can our work build on the existing strengths of the communities we seek to serve? (Costanza-Chock, 2020)
* Create an MOU with each CBO for better transparency and accountability: what resources will be provided? Who is involved and what are their roles? Who owns outputs, and who gets credit? Mitigate the asymmetry of differently resourced participant groups: what do members of the community really get out of this research work? (Costanza-Chock, 2020)
* Community members feel ignored from public hearings and advisory committees (Harrison, 2019)
