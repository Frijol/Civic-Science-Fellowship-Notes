# Working with Communities and Community-Based Research

* Asset-based rather than problem-based framing: how can our work build on the existing strengths of the communities we seek to serve? (Costanza-Chock, 2020)
* Create an MOU with each CBO for better transparency and accountability: what resources will be provided? Who is involved and what are their roles? Who owns outputs, and who gets credit? Mitigate the asymmetry of differently resourced participant groups: what do members of the community really get out of this research work? (Costanza-Chock, 2020)
* Community members feel ignored from public hearings and advisory committees (Harrison, 2019)
* Anecdotal data is useful to collect (e.g. elected official talking points, social media) in order to construct more rigorously testable questions. (Unseld, 2021)
* Survey methods also need to be context-aware, e.g. if surveying on domestic violence, the phone may be answered more often by the husband, or with spouse in room, useful to come up with flagging questions e.g. are you on speakerphone, to assess risk to group under study and validity of interpreting answers at face value (Quisumbing, 2021)
* Deciding on sensitive demographic questions: are we going to do something with this data if we ask for it? (MartinRogers, 2021)
