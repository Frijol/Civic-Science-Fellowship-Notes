# Working with Communities and Community-Based Research

## How to work with communities well
* Asset-based rather than problem-based framing: how can our work build on the existing strengths of the communities we seek to serve? (Costanza-Chock, 2020)
* Create an MOU with each CBO for better transparency and accountability: what resources will be provided? Who is involved and what are their roles? Who owns outputs, and who gets credit? Mitigate the asymmetry of differently resourced participant groups: what do members of the community really get out of this research work? (Costanza-Chock, 2020)
* Community members feel ignored from public hearings and advisory committees (Harrison, 2019)
* Anecdotal data is useful to collect (e.g. elected official talking points, social media) in order to construct more rigorously testable questions. (Unseld, 2021)
* Survey methods also need to be context-aware, e.g. if surveying on domestic violence, the phone may be answered more often by the husband, or with spouse in room, useful to come up with flagging questions e.g. are you on speakerphone, to assess risk to group under study and validity of interpreting answers at face value (Quisumbing, 2021)
* Deciding on sensitive demographic questions: are we going to do something with this data if we ask for it? (MartinRogers, 2021)

## The importance of the local
* "The less democratic a state, the more its oil extraction can thrive, as less attention needs to be paid to consequences for local inhabitants." (Wylie et al, 2017)
* The oil rig as extracting a resource using flown-in laborers who live and work separately from the local population; the whole system moveable - resulting in the political outcome of reduced local & national oversight of resource extaction (Wylie et al, 2017)
* "Developing research methods and networks that account for oil and gas infrastructures as material systems with interdependent biological, ecological, social, and political properties through hybrid physical and social science inquiry could help better affix this industry to the physical environments and communities it impacts." (Wylie et al, 2017)

### Politicization of work with communities
* "Academic work with communities is often framed as political work and can be frowned on as a form of advocacy." (Wylie et al, 2017) esp in reaction to the "neutrality" of work for industries
* "Even town hall presentations given by community members working with data gathered by [NIH-funded] scientists must be disclosed under lobbying provisions." (Wylie et al, 2017)
