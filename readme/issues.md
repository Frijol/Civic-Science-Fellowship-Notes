## EJ Issues in Environmental Governance
* Enforcement less good among vulnerable populations (Konisky and Reenock, 2015) in (Harrison, 2019)
* "One EPA rulewriter told me in 2018 that EJ analyses are rarely done and managers 'never' use EJ analyses to shape the final rule. EPA's guidance documents on rulemaking say that rulewriting staff 'can' and 'should' conduct EJ analyses to 'consider EJ' during the development of new or revised regulations, but not that they *must* do so, despite the fact that doing so is required under the National Environmental Policy Act. Moreover, agency decision-makers are under no obligation to ensure that the final rule improves material conditions in overburdened and vulnerable communities and reduces environmental inequalities. EJ advocates lament that very little of any final rule has reflected EJ concerns." (Harrison, 2019)
* "They way the agency assesses this risk [air toxics] vastly underestimates residents' exposure, according to our analysis. Instead of looking at how cancer risk adds up when polluters are clustered together in a neighborhood, the EPA examines certain types of facilities and equipment in isolation." (Vest, 2021)
* "These fence line communities are sacrifice zones. Before there was climate denial, there was cancer denial. We release millions of pounds of carcinogens into our air, water and food and act mystified when people start getting sick." Jane Williams, ED of California Communities Against Toxics (Vest, 2021)
* "Standard narrative" of agency workers for why EJ policy implementation falls short at gvt level: limited resources, regulatory authority, and analytical tools (Harrison, 2019)
* Frederick Tutman, Black riverkeeper. Talking about conflicts of influence between career-seekers and true environmental justice work: fundable, obvious, broad issues e.g. climate change can draw focus from direct needs of communities for specific and immediate pollutant changes (Tutman, 2021)
* Public servant challenges in useful dissemination of resources when data is not disaggregated (da Costa, 2021)
* Data is not equally available across all racial groups, want to be able to compare everyone in a similar manner so that we as researchers can ask questions and put data behind grassroots efforts (Sharpe, 2021)
* Often Native American community is considered statistically insignificant, left out of analyses (MartinRogers, 2021)
* "Even when penalties are issued, many polluters see these fines as part of the cost of doing business, said Craig Johnston, a former lawyer at the EPA and a professor of environmental law at Lewis and Clark Law School." (Vest, 2021)
