# Data
* "I am waiting for the study that tells me what my wealth looks like, as a single woman who doesn't have children, I've never been married— how do I compare, not just to my white peers, but how do I compare to other women, how do I compare to other men, I want to see data aggregated in that way." (Sharpe, 2021)
* Public datasets e.g. census may be used in ways not imagined by original data collectors, e.g. civil rights work from collection of demographics (Sharpe, 2021)
* Look at what's happening within the data, not just at the household level— allows for intersectional analysis (Quisumbing, 2021)
* When we're asking people to disaggregate data, we want to look at the types of questions we are trying to ask. Data disaggregation is a mechanic for stronger analysis in the context of the issue you're looking at. (Sharpe, 2021)
* Datasets & data presentation often shows categorical demographic impacts but does not let you examine intersectionally—e.g. age, race, but the question is, did a generation of Black children lose grandparents? (Sharpe, 2021)
* Rubrics for assessing data: Data completeness, dataset usability, privacy protections and FOIPOP requests, data detail, data public interoperability, staff responsiveness (Ewing, 2021) p31-37
