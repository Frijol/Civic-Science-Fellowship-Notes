# Data and Justice

## Assessing data and datasets
* Rubrics for assessing data: Data completeness, dataset usability, privacy protections and FOIPOP requests, data detail, data public interoperability, staff responsiveness (Ewing, 2021) p31-37
* Public datasets e.g. census may be used in ways not imagined by original data collectors, e.g. civil rights work from collection of demographics (Sharpe, 2021)

## Missing data
* "Data should be generated to measure how the rights of indigenous peoples to access the ownership of lands, territories and resources are being met; how their participation in decision-making and control over their own development processes are progressing; what control over data and knowledge they are achieving; and what discrimination and exclusion they experience in regard to their social, economic and cultural rights. In terms of approaches and methodologies, it was stressed in these UN forums that indigenous peoples should control these data and that their effective participation in data gathering and research should be ensured. Furthermore, resulting data should be available for use by them in policy articulation, in planning and in monitoring and evaluation efforts." (Kukutai and Taylor, xxi)

## Data that needs to be aggregated
* "We lack social and scientific methods as well as regulatory systems capable of tracking [fossil fuel and petrochemical] industries across arenas of extraction, transport, processing, and manufacture; across borders and across hazards." (Wylie et al, 2017)

## Needs for disaggregated data
* When we're asking people to disaggregate data, we want to look at the types of questions we are trying to ask. Data disaggregation is a mechanic for stronger analysis in the context of the issue you're looking at. (Sharpe, 2021)
* UN Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues recognized, in its first two sessions (2002 & 2003) that a lack of disaggregated data on indigenous peoples makes it difficult to formulate & implement indigenous-sensitive policies (Kukutai and Taylor, xxi)
* "I am waiting for the study that tells me what my wealth looks like, as a single woman who doesn't have children, I've never been married— how do I compare, not just to my white peers, but how do I compare to other women, how do I compare to other men, I want to see data aggregated in that way." (Sharpe, 2021)

### Intersectionality
* Look at what's happening within the data, not just at the household level— allows for intersectional analysis (Quisumbing, 2021)
* Datasets & data presentation often shows categorical demographic impacts but does not let you examine intersectionally—e.g. age, race, but the question is, did a generation of Black children lose grandparents? (Sharpe, 2021)
