# Design Notes

* Nothing about us, without us (Disability rights community slogan)
* All design offers affordances to some & disaffordances + dysaffordances to others (Costanza-Chock, 2020)
* Are you designing to meet the needs of a majority, or to rectify historic imbalances? Who benefits from what you build? (Costanza-Chock, 2020)
* In software, "how do you plan for governance changes? How do you ensure that the community stays healthy? How do you plan end-of-life before the first commit?" - "Born Sustainable Checklists" suggest best practices from across open source communities: one on project governance (assuming a technical project) and the other on preparing for community health. There is also a related "Governance Readiness Checklist" at https://sustainers.github.io/governance-readiness/ (Littauer et al, 2021)
* "Almost every new project passes through the tyranny of structurelessness, where a small group elite control how decisions are made. Mature organizations have done the work to figure this out, by identifying stakeholders, polling their community, and instituting blocks on power and dispersing responsibility." (Littauer et al, 2021)
