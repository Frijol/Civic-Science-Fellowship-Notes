# Design Notes

* Nothing about us, without us (Disability rights community slogan)
* All design offers affordances to some & disaffordances + dysaffordances to others (Costanza-Chock, 2020)
* Are you designing to meet the needs of a majority, or to rectify historic imbalances? Who benefits from what you build? (Costanza-Chock, 2020)
