## Ideas for improving EJ in environmental governance
* EJ variables used in (Ewing, 2021): Age, sex, immigrant population, aboriginal population, after tax income, median rent, median property value, visible minorities. Material deprivation index: prop wo hs deg, employment to pop ratio, avg income for 15 and over Social deprivation index : prop of pop over 15 living alone or sep div widowed, prop single parent (Ewing, 2021)
* Suggestions: Prioritize and increase inspections in overburdened areas, use maximum penalties, penalties should benefit community (Harrison, 2019)
* Policies to reduce inequality needs to examine where inequality is greatest: race, gender, wealthâ€” situational to context (Quisumbing, 2021)
* When policies are funded, we can scientifically test the impact of that funding. Treat policies as scientific experiments: does the policy have the desired effect? If provably no, we should not fund. If not provable, why are we not collecting the relevant data? If theory of change of a policy is unclear, why? Do talking points match the budget? (Unseld, 2021)
* Want to see researchers come in disaggregating data not just with a deficit lens, to see the "problem", but also to see what's working well, what conditions are creating success, what are the nuances (Sharpe, 2021)
* Want to see context-aware aggregation choices for data (Sharpe, 2021)
