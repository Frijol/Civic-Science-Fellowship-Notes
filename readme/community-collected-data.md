# Community-collected data
* "In contexts where there are widespread environmental and health impacts but little information about harms and their causes, communities often turn to collecting, sharing, and leveraging their own data." (Wylie et al, 2017)

## What counts?
* [in order to have impact], "Community tools must be validated by state and industry standards, which risks reinforcing rather than subverting inadequate norms of what counts as data and expanding the scientization of society such that only those with 'data' have a voice." (Wylie et al, 2017)
* "What is the responsibility for STS researchers to question the 'facticity ' or 'uncertainty' of forms of data that are instrumentally useful to for [sic] impacted communities?" - on the over-auditing of potentially flawed data that comes from citizen science, used as gatekeeping. Called the 'data treadmill' (Wylie et al, 2017)

## Critiques of citizen science
* Critique of a common form of citizen science: "These cases are based on massive, crowd-sourced data processing or observing activities where participants are engaged in science without pay, do not shape the research questions or tools, and the results of data have little impact on socio-technical systems and power relationships, not on how science is done." (Wylie et al, 2017)
* "There are always power asymmetries in citizen science, for example, between legitimized and institutionalized forms of knowledge and lay knowledge, and between citizens and accredited scientists." (Wylie et al, 2017)
* "A serious concern for us is the tension between the abdication of state environmental protections and the individualized burden of data collection (Kinchy et al. 2011). We do not want to continue a trend where non-scientists must do the work of governments and accredited scientists to be healthy." (Wylie et al, 2017)
